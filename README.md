Hello! Welcome to my second global project from the Hexlet team. In which I was able to apply even more of the skills I received. Responsiveness, accessibility, CSS Grid Layout and of course the functionality of the SASS preprocessor. All this was not easy and very exciting. Especially when submitting a project - to bring it to a pixel perfect (special hello to the Hexlet mentors).

**This project is a big step forward - to professional layout of designs.**

[Here is the result!](http://deserted-hat.surge.sh/)
